## Typescript Types:

### 1. `unknown`

- `unknown` is the type-safe counterpart of any. Anything is assignable to `unknown`, but `unknown` isnâ€™t assignable to anything but <i>itself</i> and `any` without a type assertion or a control flow based narrowing. Likewise, no operations are permitted on an unknown without first asserting or narrowing to a more specific type.
